To check if a number has been inputted into a list more than once, you can use the `count()` method in Python. This method counts how many times a specific element appears in the list. Here's how you can do it:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5]
number = 3

if my_list.count(number) > 1:
    print("Number appears more than once in the list!")
else:
    print("Number does not appear more than once.")
