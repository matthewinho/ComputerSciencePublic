#1. Write a program to convert the float datatype MyFloatValue to a string and an integer
#datatype. Use the type() command to check the conversion worked.
#str() and int() are
#used to convert to string and integer datatypes respectively.
#MyFloatValue = 9.82.
#Pay attention to what the int() cast does to the values after the decimal point.

 

myfloatnumber = 9.82

 

print(type(myfloatnumber))

 

aw =str(myfloatnumber)

 

print(type(aw))

 

 

# if u dont give it a name/ save it as something else they will both classicy as FLOAT
